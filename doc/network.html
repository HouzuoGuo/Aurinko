  <h1>Networking and concurrency support in Aurinko</h1>
  <p><em><a href="index.html">Back to Index</a></em></p>
  <p>Facts about Aurinko networking support:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>One Aurinko server instance serves one database.</li>
    <li>One new thread is created for each incoming connection.</li>
    <li>Client makes request to server using a format natively understood by Clojure programming language.</li>
    <li>Server produces responses in a format which is natively understood by Clojure programming language. (See <a href="con.html">CON</a> for more detials)</li>
    
  </ul>
  <p>Facts about concurrency in Aurinko:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All requests from all connections are queued in one <code>java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue</code></li>
    <li>There is one worker in each Aurinko server instance to work on the queue.</li>
    <li>All read operations are serialized.</li>
    <li>All write operations are serialized.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Concurrent read support is a high priority feature in the next Aurinko release.</p>
